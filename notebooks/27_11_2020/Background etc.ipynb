But development of software is a hard, time taking, and expensive process(**in 2019 Stripe** estimated a cumulative **$87B per year is lost** due to developer productivity).There is therefore an ongoing demand for innovations in software tools that help make software more reliable and maintainable. New methods are constantly sought, to reduce the complexity of software and help engineers construct better software. \n",
